# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The CNN is trained on a dataset containing images labeled as 'PNEUMONIA' and 'NORMAL.' The trained model is evaluated on a testing set, and additional analysis includes precision-recall curves, ROC curves, and a confusion matrix.

Model Architecture

The implemented CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization, dropout layers, and dense layers. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
